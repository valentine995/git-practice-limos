        Overhead costs, also known as operating expenses, are costs involved with running a company that are not related to the creation or production of a product or service. They are the costs incurred by a firm to stay in business, regardless of its level of success. Office expenses for example postage and printing, research and development and telephone expenses Activity-Based Cost Allocation is one of the strategies. 
       Activity-based indirect costing is a method of allocating overhead and indirect costs, such as salaries and utilities, to products and services. This approach of assigning indirect expenses takes longer, but it is also more precise. Managers must first identify and record each business action carried out by their departments. The activities are then classified as having direct or indirect expenses. Records are examined, indirect cost rates are determined, and the appropriate indirect costs are assigned at the end of the reporting period, such as at the end of the month.
